        The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly
        becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for
        people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting
        police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding
        handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the
        nickname "man's best friend" in the Western world. In some cultures,
        however, dogs are also a source of meat.
